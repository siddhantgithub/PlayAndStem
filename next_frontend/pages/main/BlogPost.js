Especially effective for people with visual or cognitive impairments or people who are on the go. I came up with the idea to implement it for my blog, so this is how I started doing a research on this topic which ended up being a tutorial for you. So in this tutorial, we will go through the process of building a text-to-speech component in React. We will use the Web Speech API to implement the text-to-speech functionality.";
